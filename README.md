This project involves developing a comprehensive Deep Learning solution tailored for agriculture. We will construct an Image Classification Model specifically designed to identify different types of diseases affecting potato leaves. Our approach will employ a straightforward Convolutional Neural Network Architecture. The project will follow a structured process, beginning with data collection, followed by model development, and concluding with the creation of a user-friendly web-based application using Streamlit.
